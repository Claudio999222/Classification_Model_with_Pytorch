# Classification Model with PyTorch

This repository provides an in-depth exploration of building classification models using PyTorch, a powerful library for deep learning and machine learning tasks. Classification is a supervised learning technique used to predict categorical labels. This repository covers various aspects of building classification models, including data preprocessing, model architecture, training, evaluation, and application to real-world datasets.

## Features

- **Introduction to Classification**: Understand the basics of classification, its types, and how it differs from other machine learning tasks.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Learn how to preprocess data, including normalization, augmentation, and splitting into training and test sets.
- **Model Architecture**: Explore various neural network architectures suitable for classification tasks.
- **Training the Model**: Detailed guide on training the model, including defining the loss function and optimizer, and implementing the training loop.
- **Model Evaluation**: Techniques to evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Practical Examples**: Implement practical examples and tutorials to illustrate the use of classification models in real-world scenarios.
